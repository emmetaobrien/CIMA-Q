# CIMA-Q
## Overview
Alzheimer's (AD) and related diseases affect 10% of individuals after the age of 65 and this percentage increases to 35% after the age of 85. Currently, AD is typically diagnosed when symptoms are already present, with cognition, quality of life, and autonomy already significantly affected, though evidence shows this is often years after neurodegeneration has started in the brain. Efforts are necessary to reduce the psychological, social and economic burden that AD places on patients, their families and society. The Consortium for the early identification of Alzheimer's disease - Québec (CIMA-Q) cohort is a longitudinal, multicentric, multifactorial and intersectorial study that aims to identify trajectories, as well as protective and vulnerability factors, of AD, to improve early diagnosis and to find new targets for prevention and treatment.

## Participants
The CIMA-Q cohort participants are representative of different AD stages (pre-symptomatic and symptomatic). Recruitment started at the end of 2014 and as of September 2024, **419 participants aged 65 and over** (64,5 % women) ** were recruited for the CIMA-Q cohort and were classified in 4 different groups. Sixty-eight were recruited as cognitively healthy (C) participants, 181 as participants with a subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 134 with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 36 with early-stage AD. The CIMA-Q project continues to recruit participants and is aiming to reach a total of 250 participants with at least one completed follow-up evaluation after their initial assessment (150 SCD and 100 MCI participants). We are also currently recruiting young controls (YC) (between 20 and 45 year old) for CSF sample controls.

## Methods and available data
The study’s detailed **protocol** and procedures for accessing data and biological samples are available at  [this site](http://www.cima-q.ca/en/data-cima-q/). Participants are initially evaluated and then participants recruited as SCD and TCL invited back for a full assessment every 2 years, in addition to which there is a short phone clinical assessment in between the full assessment follow-ups. All the data and biomaterial collected for more than 9 years now are available in the CIMA-Q data and biomaterial bank. All participants included in the study consent to neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric and clinical assessments and to provide blood samples. Apart from these evaluations, participants can consent to a Magnetic Resonance Neuroimaging (MRI), a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling. (Belleville, *et al*. 2019). Participants can also separately consent to brain donation.
Access to CIMA-Q data and samples is restricted to CIMA-Q members and conditional upon (i) the approval by the CIMA-Q User Access committee and the CIMA-Q Executive Committee, and (ii) an independent ethical approval of each project.
